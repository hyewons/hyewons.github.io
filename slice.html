    			<p class= "content1 center">
    				The idea of eating as a social activity is nothing new. However, there seems to be significant inefficiencies that prevent the diners from having pleasant dining experience. From waiting to get seated to fighting for waiter’s attention to the unfortunate task of splitting the bill, that dinner night can turn out to be a nightmare. Meanwhile, technology in the restaurant industry is rapidly becoming the new normal as 81% of the restaurants use a point-of-sales (POS)  system. Today’s POS systems like Breadcrumb and Square are advanced enough to feature multiple card processing, labor management, and integration with other software. <span style="font-weight:600">We should leverage current POS system technology to enhance the dining experience.</span>

    				Since there exists many frustrating moments at different stages, we needed to narrow down the project scope through user research. We conducted open-ended interviews with frequent diners, including former waiters, to understand their habits & experience from both sides. After uncovering common frustrations (which are ordering and billing process), we sent out online survey with a focus on those frustrations. The insights from the research were critical in narrowing down on designing a solution for a better billing experience.

    		<p class= "content2">
    				We iterated on the service concept, and made sure it aligns with our users' needs and values from the research. Our final solution is a mobile app that improves efficiency of the billing process by enabling the users to take care of the bill by themselves and thus helping the waiters to focus more on other tasks. Our solution is under two assumptions:

    		<div class="block40"></div>
    		<h4 class="subtitle2 "> Assumption #1</h4>
    		<p class= "content2" style="margin-top: -30px">
    			Diners eating at high-end, expensive restaurants will not be facing billing problems discussed above. The customer service will be top-notch in those restaurants and diners are most likely to have discussed how the bill will be split in advance of the meal.Therefore, we are targeting users who dine at casual, average-priced sit-down restaurants.
    		</p>
    		<div class="block40"></div>
    		<h4 class="subtitle2"> Assumption #2</h4>
    		<p class= "content2" style="margin-top: -30px">
    			Restaurants will have advanced POS system so that they can install our software to their POS system, which enables connection with the user’s phone. When connected, the POS data (order details & bill) will be sent directly to the user’s phone.

	    			The first version (left) solves selecting from multiple quantity item. But what if Jane had one Mixed Vegetable and shared the second one with Paul? This scenario prompted the second version (middle)	where the drop down arrow seperates Mixed Vegetables into three items. This looked like the most ideal version, but after some evaluation, the drop down box is not intuitive and takes up too much space. We wanted an interaction that keeps the simple interaction of the first version and accomodates these edge case scenarios. We finalized with the third screen (right), where users are given the simple interaction as a default and additional options to split item manually.

	    			Users paying all items on the bill perfectly is an ideal scenario. However, there are always human errors. What if some item is not paid and the bill starter gets charged for someone else's food? Then no one will want to be the bill starter. This was a critical problem to solve. The first version (left) inhibits the users from payment until all items have been claimed. However, this creates another "waiting" moment that we wanted to remove in the first place. We finalized with the second version (right) where everyone is shown the unpaid item(s) immediately after their payment so they can settle the issue at the spot.
