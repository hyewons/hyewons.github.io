    			<p class= "content1 center">
    				The idea of eating as a social activity is nothing new. People dine out to have a quality time but there seems to be significant inefficiencies that prevent them from having pleasant dining experience. From waiting to get seated to fighting for waiter’s attention to splitting complex bill, that dinner night can turn out to be a nightmare. Meanwhile, technology in the restaurant industry is rapidly becoming the new normal as 81 percent of the restaurants use a point-of-sales (POS)  system. Today’s POS systems like Breadcrumb and Square are advanced enough to feature multiple card processing, labor management, and integration with other software. <span style="font-weight:600">We should leverage current POS system technology to enhance the dining experience.</span>

    			<p class= "content2">
    				Since there exists many frustrating moments at different stages, we decided to conduct user research to narrow down the project scope. We conducted open-ended interviews with frequent diners, including former waiters, to understand their habits & experience from both sides. After uncovering common frustrations (which are ordering and billing process), we sent out online survey with a focus on those frustrations. The insights from the research were critical in narrowing down on designing a solution for a better billing experience.

    		<p class= "content2">
    				We iterated on the service concept, and made sure it aligns with our users' needs and values from the research. Our final solution is a mobile app that improves efficiency of the billing process by enabling the users to take care of the bill by themselves and thus helping the waiters to focus more on other tasks. Our solution is under two assumptions:

    		<div class="block40"></div>
    		<h4 class="subtitle2 "> Assumption #1</h4>
    		<p class= "content2" style="margin-top: -30px">
    			Diners eating at high-end, expensive restaurants will not be facing billing problems discussed above. The customer service will be top-notch in those restaurants and diners are most likely to have discussed how the bill will be split in advance of the meal.Therefore, we are targeting users who dine at casual, average-priced sit-down restaurants.

    		<div class="block40"></div>
    		<h4 class="subtitle2"> Assumption #2</h4>
    		<p class= "content2" style="margin-top: -30px">
    			Restaurants will have advanced POS system so that they can install our software to their POS system, which enables connection with the user’s phone. When connected, the POS data (order details & bill) will be sent directly to the user’s phone.

    			Sharing a meal is about getting together, without tech in between. It was challenging to streamline the app tominimize screen during the meal. That’s why we decided with waiter checking-in the users.
    			<br> As my first time working with someone remotely, my partner and I developed few methods that allow us to collaborate in an efficient fashion. We iterated on each other’s ideas to combine all perspectives, and always seek answers from our users when we cannot find one on our own.
